# My-Python-Portfolio-
The is a collection of my python projects from AP Comp Sci.

1) Pokemon Evolution
   This code is an interactive game where the user can evolve their pokemon. This game is a simulation of Pokemon go and contains similar features like training in gyms and battleing others. The days you complete and level you are on is kept track of, and the user is able to view their stats.

2) Teddy Bear Simulation
   In this code I constructed a teddy bear with my partner. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing a teddy bear picture in real time. I used the turtle library's commands to make this art.

3) Teen Titan's House
   In this code I constructed the teen titans go hosue with my partners. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing the house and its setting in real time. I used the turtle library and for loops to create the house.

4) Ticket Generator
   In this code the user is able to generate themselves a ticket with customizable name, day, price, and location on screen. I used parameters in my function to let the user input their info on the ticket. The user can edit the code to change the font style and size, to match the ticket to it's occasion.

5) Underwater Scene
   This code constucts and underwater landscape with customizable fish, seaweed, and other elements. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing the underwater scene with respect to the users input on the parameters. The user can change the color, size, and location on screen of the elements.
