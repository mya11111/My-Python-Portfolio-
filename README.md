# My-Python-Portfolio-
The is a collection of my python projects from AP Comp Sci.

1) Cartier Jewelry Finder
   This code filters and sorts through database lists to identify the perfect peice of jewelry for the user. The user can get a reccomendation, or search by name, or search by reference number, for a specific peice. The code also gives the user the option to display names of all the pieces. An aesthetic addition to this code is when run, it displays a photo of cartiers most well known jewelry. This code was my create task for the ap computer science exam.

3) Mothers Day Teddy Bear Simulation
   In this code I constructed a teddy bear with my partner, but altered the code to project a heart with a message for mothers day. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing a cute teddy bear picture in real time. I used the turtle library's commands to make this art.

4) Pokemon Evolution
   This code is an interactive game where the user can evolve their pokemon. This game is a simulation of Pokemon go and contains similar features like training in gyms and battleing others. The days you complete and level you are on is kept track of, and the user is able to view their stats.

5) Prison Escape Story
   This is an interactive story code. WHen run, the user's objective is to escape prison before their death sentance occurs. The user is presented with options on how to spend their remaining days and needs to hatch an escape plan.

6) Teen Titan's House
   In this code I constructed the teen titans go hosue with my partners. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing the house and its setting in real time. I used the turtle library and for loops to create the house.

7) Underwater Scene
   This code constucts and underwater landscape with customizable fish, seaweed, and other elements. When run, the curser goes through the process of drawing the underwater scene with respect to the users input on the parameters. The user can change the color, size, and location on screen of the elements.
